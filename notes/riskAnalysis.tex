\chapter{Risk Analysis}
The planning of any major project involves certain risks. The larger the project, the more diverse and potentially dangerous the risks are for the success of the project. For this reason, project managers are well advised to do a risk analysis when planning the project in order to identify risks at an early stage and to counter them. The first step is to identify and analyse risks in all areas related to the project.

\section{Risk Identification}
Risks can arise in all areas that have something to do with the project. These include financial risks, risks in time management, human resources and delays in the execution of tasks. External processes such as shortages of suppliers or even the weather can also have an influence on the project and are therefore to be regarded as risks. The risks identified for this project and an estimate of the Probability of Occurence (PoO) are listed in the following table \ref{risk-table}.
