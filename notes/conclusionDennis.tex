\section{Conclusion - Dennis Mueller}
The team has harmonized beautifully. At the beginning it was soon clear who knew which topic best and how we could best distribute the roles among ourselves. The evaluation of the abilities in the given Excel sheet helped us in this process, allowing us to apply a value to all the abilities of the individual team member and thereby split the responsibilities among us.
\\
The decision to implement the project with state of the art technologies, namely a RESTfull backend service, enabled us to design a Swagger interface definition together and then implement the frontend and the backend independently of each other.
\\
The Gantt project plan and the todos within the online kanban board helped us to keep track of the current progress of the project.
\\
Focusing on customer satifaction also appeals to me personally and the surveys helped me to successfully achieve this goal.
The teamwork was smooth and our regular meetings via appear.in - where every participant can share his screen - enabled us to work well remotely.
That's why the initial chapters are all written by the whole team, because I wrote the chapters live and the others were able to give their input on what we want to write.
\\
Negative points would be that the usability of some of the project management tools we had tested are sometimes quite bad - for example Planhammer.io.
