\chapter{Customer Feedback}
\label{sec:org4718a3c}

High customer satisfaction is very important to our team. Professor Mousavi also
made it very clear in his lectures that in a good project management the
feedback of the customer is very important. For this reason, the project manager
should regularly request feedback from the customer. We have therefore sent a
survey to our customer three times.

\subsection{Understanding the customer}
\label{sec:org62e7666}
The first survey was mainly about clarifying general questions, so that these can be taken into account in the project
management. Financial topics were addressed specifically and an attempt was made
to bring the features resulting from the specifications into a prioritized
order. This has helped us a lot to focus on
the features that are most important to our customers. The results of the
questions regarding design and performance also gave us conclusions as to which
technologies we should use and how much time we should invest in UI design.

The respond from our customers.
\begin{verse}
	Hello Mr. Mueller,\\
	\vspace*{1em}
	thank you for your prototype. My colleagues and I had a look at this yesterday.\\
	We are very enthusiastic about the design and usability.\\
	However, we would like to change the following.\\
	We would like the incoming alarm notifications to be visible on every page,\\
	not just on the dashboard.\\
	We would also like the user to manually mark them as read.\\
	
	But with the rest we are very pleased.
