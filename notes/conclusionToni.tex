\section{Conclusion - Antonio Parrotta}
This project has shown how much effort and time it takes to get an as accurate assessment of projects as possible. It is important for the customer to know what the project planning and its risks are, as suppliers from different companies usually have to work together. Coordination and overview are therefore of great importance. After all, the customer pays a lot of money for a service. It is normal that he wants to know exactly how things are going and how much progress has been made. 
\\
Another important point is the cost calculation. Costs are often not the deciding factor. Nevertheless, they should be within a fair and acceptable framework. With the right argumentation, even high-priced articles can be justified.
\\
The mood of the customer is often difficult to assess. That is why it makes sense and is important to have constant contact with customers. Intensive communication is ensured with questionnaires or discussions. In this way, changes or wishes of the customer or ideas of the developers can be taken into account.
\\
This project has clearly shown that it is not a matter of fact to have a good customer contact as well as an exact planning. This is because unexpected scenarios can arise that require dynamic action.
