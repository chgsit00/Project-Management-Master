** Surveillance of the public spaces
- video cameras for (hardware purchase and installation)
  - parking lot
  - entrances
  - lunch area
  - chill room
  - communical area
  - elevators 
- archive backup file system
  - NAS with redundance (RAID 2)
  - Backup also with (RAID 2)
  - label the files with location and timestamp for searching later
** Smoke detection
- In every room or corridor
- Smoke detectors with network capabilities 
- Tracking the alarms with within the system (location and time)
- Dashboard should be able visualize alarms origin  

** Window and door status listed in the central hub
- Buy wireless detectors/ sensors for doors and windows
- Create interface for sensors to communicate with the central system
- Dashboard should visualize the state of the doors and windows
** Safe deposit of monitoring feeds
- Central system needs a database for persitent data storage 
- Redudant backup system

* 24/7 real-time Health Monitoring facilities
** Monitoring of inhabitants without breaking the laws of privacy
- Buy motion detectors ( + installation)
- Create interface for detectors to communicate with the backend
- Dashboard should visualize the data of the motion detectors for each room

** Health Monitoring
- Heart rate  monitoring with smart wrist bands
  - wrist band communicate with the backend
  - not mandatory for every resident - resident can decide for their own (or doctor orders it)
  - realtime monitoring via frontend for each resident who has a wrist band by their location (GPS)
  - implement alarm logic, when monitored health data shows critical state
  - alarm when dementia patient is near entrance (though RFID)

- Emergency button
  - purchase emergency buttons that can communicate with a central hub or backend
  - installation and create interface for communication with backend 
  - log the frequency of the usage of each button (location / time) and store it in the database 
  - provide access to the logs by the frontend and implement searching and filtering features

* Engineering services
** Central hub that lists the status of the building infrastructure 
- A silent alarm to the personal if a critical device is failing
- technical staff should be able to access the state of devices that are out of order
  - sensors
  - lights
  - elevators
  - heating
** ticket system for manual issue managment and tracking their state
- technical staff and medical staff can manage the issues (add, update, delete)
- design and implement a GUI for the staff that allows them to manage the issues

* Energy and water consumption
** Monitoring of water and energy consumption
- Design and implement a GUI for the technical staff to monitor the consumption
- Buy smart power meters and water meters that can communicate with the backend
- Log and aggragate the data in the database
- Implement filtering and searching features for the stored data
** Central heating control
- Residents can control the room temperature
- Purchase heating controls that can communicate with the backend (installation and integration into  the system)
- Purchase temperature sensors that can communicate with the backend (installation and integration into  the system)
- Dashboard should visualize the temperature and heating settings of each room
* Cleanliness and outbuilding services
** Tracking of cleaning services
- design and implement a GUI for the medical staff to save the date and room for which the cleaning service was done
- implement backend and database for storing the data
** An easy way to report contaminations
- design an GUI for HMI-panels that provide an easy way to report contaminations
  - should be placed in all public rooms
  - the GUI should have buttons for different kind of urgent problems
    - cleaning service
    - emergency
- design and implement a GUI for the medical staff to report contaminations 
- implement backend and database for storing the data
* Residents satisfaction
** CORE 
- automatic feedback generation based on input of manager (food quality, room
  temperature, cleanliness of rooms, (maybe) staff kindness)
** Optional registration for health services like heart rate and location tracking
- design and implement a GUI for the medical staff for storing which person was given a wrist band 
- implement backend and database for storing the data
** Info board for events
- Purchase flat screen (installation and integration in the system)
- Web frontend that is also accessable on mobile devices
- implement backend and database for storing the data


* Technical Specification 
- Settings Page
- timer for checking for critical states of
  - windows, door states
  - heart rate
- Database for data persitents
- RFID instead of GPS for location tracking
- generate templates for reports
- mobile app for android tablets (for medical staff and cleaning staff, manager)
