# RUN the backend
 TODO
# RUN the frontend
There are two ways to do that:

### Method 1 ) Use the python SimpleWebServer ( Recommended)
#### For Python 2.7
- go to the folder iCareFrontend and execute the following command:
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5001
- navigate in the browser to http://localhost:5001/

#### For Python 3
- go to the folder iCareFrontend and execute the following command:
    python -m http.server
- navigate in the browser to http://localhost:8000/

### Method 2) Use the java SimpleWebServer ( had problems with finding css files)
- go to the folder iCareFrontend and execute the following command:
    java -jar SimpleWebServer.jar
- navigate in the browser to http://localhost:80/
